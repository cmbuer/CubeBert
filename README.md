## Details
The current build of CubeBert is the demo stage of a third-person, follow-camera 3D platformer.  Inspired by contemporary takes on classic games and aesthetics, CubeBert has an intentionally low-poly, retro-futuristic look.  All objects in the game are composed of Unity editor primitives.  (While elaborations of the game are likely to see some external 3D models, their design will remain consistent with this look.)  This general aesthetic is carried over into other elements of the design like the music and splash screen artwork, which are informed by and allude to several 1980s sources in particular.

In this demo, CubeBert faces down robot drones with a stylized penguin shape and laser emitters in their beaks trying to run and jump his way to safety.  His movements are facilitated by a hand-coded inverse kinematics system based on the FABRIK algorithm white paper.

While the music and sound effects came from the Unity asset store, the bulk of the project is homegrown.

Controls are simple, and in the standard FPS style:  WASD keys for movement, shift to jump.
